# Web Application Development Course

## Course Description:

This course provides an in-depth exploration of web application development using .NET Core API and React in TypeScript. Students will learn to design, develop, and deploy full-stack web applications, gaining proficiency in both backend and frontend development technologies.

## Course Learning Objectives (CLOs):

1. Design and develop RESTful Web APIs using .NET Core, emphasizing the implementation of endpoints, request/response handling, and middleware to facilitate communication between the client and server.
2. Gain proficiency in utilizing .NET Core features such as dependency injection, configuration, and routing to build scalable and maintainable Web API applications.
3. Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms in .NET Core Web APIs, including token-based authentication (JWT) and role-based access control (RBAC), to secure API endpoints and manage user access.

4. Develop front-end components and user interfaces using React.js library in TypeScript, applying component-based architecture principles, and leveraging React's lifecycle methods, state management, and props for building interactive and responsive UIs.
5. Utilize TypeScript's static typing features to enhance code reliability, maintainability, and developer productivity in React applications, including defining interfaces, type annotations, and enforcing type checking throughout the development process.
6. Design and implement effective communication between front-end React components and back-end .NET Core Web APIs using asynchronous HTTP requests (fetch) and RESTful API conventions, ensuring efficient data exchange, error handling, and synchronization while adhering to best practices in client-server communication.

## Course Organization:

1. **Theory and Live Coding Sessions:**
   - Regular sessions covering essential concepts and practical demonstrations for all student groups.

2. **Practical Labs:**
   - Structured lab sessions for hands-on practice and reinforcement of concepts.

3. **Project Development Hours:**
   - Dedicated time for supervised group project work.

4. **Supplementary Workshops:**
   - Additional sessions to address specific knowledge or skill gaps relevant to the project.

## Course Assessment:

The course will be assessed through two main components:

1. **Group Project:**
   - Building a minimum viable web application based on given case studies.
   - Evaluation criteria include functionality, usability, design, and code quality.
   - *More about assesment*


2. **End-Term Individual Exam:**
   - Assessing understanding of course concepts, principles, and practical application.
   - Exam format may include multiple-choice questions, short-answer questions, and coding exercises.

Both components are mandatory, and students must pass both assessments to receive a final grade for the course.
