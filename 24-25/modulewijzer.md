# Web Application Development Course

## Course Description:

This course provides an in-depth exploration of web application development using .NET Core API and React in TypeScript. Students will learn to design, develop, and deploy full-stack web applications, gaining proficiency in both backend and frontend development technologies.

## Course Learning Objectives (CLOs):

1. Design and develop RESTful Web APIs using .NET Core, emphasizing the implementation of **endpoints**, request/response handling to facilitate communication between the client and server.

2. Gain proficiency in utilizing .NET Core features such as **dependency injection**, configuration, routing, and data persistence.

3. Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms in .NET Core Web APIs, including **middleware, filters**, token-based authentication (JWT) and role-based access control (RBAC), to secure API endpoints and manage user access.

4. Design and implement a **functional programming solution in Typescript**, applying principles of pure functions, immutability, higher-order functions, function composition, polymorphism, advanced hierarchical data structures, recursion, currying, and closures to solve a complex problem.

5. Develop **front-end components** and user interfaces using React.js library in TypeScript, applying component-based architecture principles, and leveraging React's lifecycle methods, state management, and props for building interactive and responsive UIs.


6. Design and implement effective communication between front-end React components and back-end .NET Core Web APIs using asynchronous HTTP requests (fetch) and RESTful API conventions, ensuring efficient **data exchange**, error handling, and synchronization while adhering to best practices in client-server communication.

## Course Organization:

1. **Theory and Live Coding Sessions:**
   - Regular sessions covering essential concepts and practical demonstrations for all student groups.

2. **Practical Labs:**
   - Structured lab sessions for hands-on practice and reinforcement of concepts.

3. **Project Development Hours:**
   - Dedicated time for supervised group project work.

4. **Supplementary Workshops:**
   - Additional sessions to address specific knowledge or skill gaps relevant to the project.

## Course Assessment:

The course will be assessed through two main components: In order to get a grade the student need to have minimum passing grade i.e. >= 5.5 in each of assessment. A final grade will be average of both assessment if and only iff both actives are sufficient. 
e.g. Student Grade  = (Grade from Exam + Grade from Project ) / 2  
Success scenario = Exam Grade = 7, Project Grade = 8 so the course grade is (7+8)/2 = 7.5 
Failure scenarios: ND in both Exam & Project , final grade = ND
                   Exam Grade < 5.5 or ND , ..... final grade  = NVL (fail)
                   Project Grade < 5.5 or ND,  .... final grade  = NVL (fail) 

1. **Group Project:**
   - Building a minimum viable web application based on given case studies.
   - Evaluation criteria include functionality, usability, design, and code quality.

2. **End-Term Individual Exam:**
   - Assessing understanding of course concepts, principles, and practical application by applying them in the code. 
   - Exam format include on spot coding exercises.

3. **Assessment Moments**
there will be two moments of formal assessment, a **mid term** comprising of 30% of the total grade, and 70% of **final exam**. A **repair** work will be allowed for project part, and a **retake** will be available for exam part. 


Both components are mandatory, and students must pass both assessments to receive a final grade for the course.
