  ### Setup of React project and JSX (week 1)
  After this week you will understand what React is as a framework and its main purpose. You will learn what is needed to setup
  a standalone React application. Later we will see how to connect the React app to the backend (.NET).

  The main focus should be on the different ways React can be used and which solution would be the best fit for the project.
  
  **Setting up a React App**
  There are many different ways of getting started with React. The easiest way and the way we will use will be with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). With just as single command you bootstrap your application to get started with. 

  > Note: Create React App is actually a depricated tool and not being recommended anymore on the official React website. However the tool can still be used and provides an easy way to learn and discover the possibillities of React. For other ways to create a React App check the official [React website](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project).

  **Building your own toolchain**
  Besides all the tools that are allready arround to help you get started with React you can also setup your own React development environment. This environment is called a toolchain. It's unlikely that you will use this in a production environment, but building a React App from scratch will give you a deeper level of understanding what the framework is and what happens under the hood.
